# EasyCompiler
A _by the book_ compiler framework written in TypeScript.

## General Description
Its main purpose is to be used in teaching compiler and compiler optimization. While LLVM is a very powerfull framework, due to its complexity, it is not best suited in education. The purpose of easycompiler is to provide educators and students with a powerful tool.

## Packages Description
The compiler is made of multiple packages, which can then be separately imported into projects, based on what is needed. Packages are linked using the [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) tool.

### @easycompiler/ast
The AST package is a collection of classes that will contain information from each node.

### @easycompiler/frontend

### @easycompiler/optimizer

### @easycompiler/backend

## Installation and Usage
To start using the compiler, the compiler packages should be installed using _npm_, and then imported into your project.
